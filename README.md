## 🛠️ What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis  
- Aggregated **weekly sales** into **monthly totals**  
- Visualized **sales trends, moving averages, and seasonality**  
- Broke down **revenue by departments and stores**  
- Built a **basic forecast** using Rolling Mean & Exponential Smoothing  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Sales show clear **seasonal patterns** around holidays and year-end  
- Certain **departments consistently outperform others**  
- Regional store performance varies significantly, highlighting demand differences  
- Moving averages and smoothing help **capture long-term trends**
